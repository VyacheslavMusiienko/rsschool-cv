## About Myself:
### I got interested in web application development a few years ago when I first tried to build small websites. Since then, I have been terribly passionate about it. I started learning different programming languages and creating small projects of my own. ###
### In addition, I carefully study English because I understand that this language is extremely important and necessary for those who intend to work in an international IT company in the future. ###
### As far as learning is concerned, I try to combine all the knowledge I have accumulated and try to deepen my understanding. I have decided to take this path, which combines with my ability to solve problems related to the development of Internet services. I feel that my passion for writing code will allow me to make significant progress during my studies. ###
